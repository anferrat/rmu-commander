## App

The app is available in Google Play Store - [RMU Commander](https://)

## Usage

RMU commander allows to send On/Of/ContinuousInterruption commands to Mobiltex's Remote Monitoring Units (works with RMU3).


## Features
 - **Fast and simple** - quick and reliable way to send comands from the device in field.

 - **Auto-login and Save password** - login once and have your credentials stored on device in encrypted storage.
 - **No more "Send Verification e-mail"** - seriously, it is annoying...
 - **Save interruption configurations** - create configurations with On/Off cycles and use them to send interruption commands, without entering cycle time every time.
 - **Adaptive time selection** - select desired duration of interruption instead of typing start and end dates.

## Limitations

- Only supporting Continuous Interruption, Turn On and Turn Off commands.
- You can only send commands and see site and command status updates. To view sites' data use the official web app.
- Even though it's written in RN, there is currently no way to upload it to AppStore anyways.
